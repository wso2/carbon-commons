<h1>Java2WSDL Tool</h1>

<p>Java2WSDL allows you to generate the WSDL for Java code that is already
written to provide a Web service. This tool helps you to develop Web services
in the code first approach, where the development starts with the code and
thereafter you derive the WSDL from the source. </p>
