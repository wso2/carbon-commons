    <h1>WSDL2Code Tool</h1>
    The WSDL2Code tool is used to generate Java code to provide or consume a Web
    service for a given WSDL. You can use this tool to develop Web services for
    contract first development. This tool provides many options to customize your
    code.
    <ol>
        <li>In the navigator, under Tools, click
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">WSDL</span><strong style="font-weight: bold;">2Java</strong><span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">.</span> The
            <strong>WSDL2 Code</strong> page appears.
        </li>
        <li>Fill in the fields as required.</li>
        <li>Enter the URL of the WSDL in the the <strong>uri</strong> field. Entering a value in this field is
            mandatory.
        </li>
        <li>Click <strong>Generate</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Each option is described on the <strong>WSDL2
        Code</strong> page.</p>

    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: If the WSDL has XSDs that are imported from the file system, then first archive those
        XSDs and WSDL together into a zip. Then upload the zip.
