How to run the cluster management sample
----------------------------------------

Manual Method
-------------
1. Download a WSO2 Carbon distribution or any WSO2 product that adheres to the
WSO2 Carbon architecture.

2. Extract the distribution downloaded in step 1, say the extracted directory is
wso2carbon.

3. Make 3 copies of the wso2carbon directory created in step 2, say wso2carbon-CM,
wso2carbon-1 & wso2carbon-2. wso2carbon-CM is going to be the cluster manager &
wso2carbon-1 is going to be a member in group1, and wso2carbon-2 is going to be
a member in group2.

4. copy the conf directories found in this sample to the respective directories
created in step 3. Replace all existing configurations files.

5. Copy the org.wso2.carbon.cluster.mgt.core-<version>.jar to the
$CARBON/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/plugins directory in all 3 directories created in
step 3.

6. Copy the org.wso2.carbon.cluster.mgt.admin-<version>.jar &
org.wso2.carbon.cluster.mgt.admin.ui-<version>.jar files to the
wso2carbon-CM/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/plugins directory

7. Run the 3 WSO2 Carbon instances.

8. Point your Web browser to https://localhost:9443/carbon. You should
see the cluster management menu in the Management Console.

Automatic Method
----------------
1. Download a WSO2 Carbon distribution or any WSO2 product that adheres to the
WSO2 Carbon architecture.

2. Extract the distribution downloaded in step 1, say the extracted directory is
wso2carbon.

3. In this cluster management distribution, go to the sample1 directory and run;
ant -Dcarbon.home=<carbon_home> -Dclustermgt.home=<clustermgt_home>

Here carbon_home is the extracted directory in step2 & clustermgt_home is
the directory where this cluster management component is extracted to.
