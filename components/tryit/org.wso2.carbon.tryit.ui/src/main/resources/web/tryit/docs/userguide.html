<h1>Try It </h1>

<p>Try It is a tool available with the WSO2 Carbon that allows you to try 
out your own Web Services Definition Language
(WSDL) or any publicly available WSDL of the document/literal style.</p>

<p>Try It provides you with a mechanism to test your WSDL by creating end
points on-the-fly. It helps to test a WSDL before actually coding it, without
the need for a third party WSDL validator tool. </p>

<h2>Using Try It</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In the navigator, under Tools, click <strong>Try It</strong>. The
    <em><strong>Enter WSDL 1.1 or 2.0 Document Location</strong></em> page
    appears. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Enter URL</strong> field, type or paste the location of
    the WSDL. It may be a local file system path, or a web URL.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Try It</strong>. 
    <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: If your browser has Pop up-Blocking enabled, you
    will receive a message saying a pop up was blocked. Allow pop ups for the
    current domain and try again.
    
    The available operations in the given WSDL appears. For operations that
    take arguments, you will see primitive argument type fields. The values
    specified in these fields will be passed to the operations. For
    no-argument operations, you will only see the button that has the same
    name as the operation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Two textareas can be seen, each for request and response. You can
      switch the layout using either <strong>Horizontal</strong> or <strong>Vertical</strong> buttons.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Send</strong> button to invoke that service operation. The return value
    immediately appears in the response textarea.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Choosing Endpoints</strong></h3>

<p>Use this function to change the endpoint for the service, if there are
multiple endpoints. You can even specify a customized endpoint.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>Using Enpoint - ....</strong>.
      (It can be seen above the Request-Response textareas)</li>
  <li>Select the endpoint you want, and specify the address of the new
    endpoint.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Prioritize Operations</strong></h3>

<p>Use the small yellow icon with the plus(+) sign, to prioritize operations.
    Then they will be added to the <strong>Priority Operations</strong> section.</p>
<p>This will be useful when you have a lot of operations in the tryit page.
    Then you can add operations you want into this section and switch among them easily.</p>
